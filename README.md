This repository contains research from my Data Science internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Our 5-person team investigated amodal segmentation for occluded object reconstruction using U-Net architectures, custom loss functions (Dice, Weighted BCE, Masked L1), and multimodal video segmentation via SAM2. Also prototyped a diffusion-based generative model to enhance amodal completion in RGB images and videos.
